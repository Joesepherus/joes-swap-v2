# Joes Swap v2
Upgraded version of Joes Swap v1.

This is a very basic implementation of a Decentralized Exchange using Solidity and Foundry.

## What got introduced in v2
1. Real ERC20 tokens as pairs
2. Swap the other way around
3. Fix the slippage - good samaritan
4. Add possibility to set maxAmount of token1 for amount of token0 and vice versa
5. Hand out LP tokens to liquidity providers - as fees
6. Add events and errors
7. Add natspec

## Where this can be improved
3. Make the swaps non-linear
4. Hand out LP tokens to liquidity providers
8. Add checks
